Lab for Intelligence and visiON (LION) commits to designing trustworthy intelligent visual recognition systems for real-world applications. To achieve this goal, we mainly focus on the areas of data augmentation, unsupervised/weakly-/semi-supervised learning, federated learning, domain generalization/adaptation and novel class discovery, and investigate their advantages in visual tasks, such as object retrieval, image classification, semantic segmentation, multi-modality recognition, etc. Our research outcomes are targeting top-tier venues, including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, IJCV, TPAMI, etc.

[//]: # (Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page]&#40;/multi-language-al-folio/publications/&#41; automatically.)

This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons]&#40;https://fontawesome.com/&#41; and [Academicons]&#40;https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/&#41;, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.)
